## Retail Store Data Modeling and Analysis using DataStage
# Project Overview:
The project implements a star-schema data warehousing flow, then utilize IBM InfoSphere DataStage to develop efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to create data marts and perform some analysis on them.
The objective is to store and analyze data from a fictional retail store in a star-schema-based analysis data warehouse while ensuring all changes in the dimensions are preserved.
